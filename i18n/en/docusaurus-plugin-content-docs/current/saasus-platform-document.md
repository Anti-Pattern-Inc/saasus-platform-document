# SaaSus Platform Document

## Issues for SaaS providers or those who are about to become SaaS providers

SaaS is more than just "providing software over the Internet." The greatest advantage for users is that they can continue to use the latest best practices with software that contains constantly improved specialized best practices. Therefore, an impressive SaaS motivates users to keep using it.

However, when trying to provide SaaS, or when SaaS is provided, problems and issues with characteristics different from conventional application sales arise. For example, compared an application installed per system, SaaS always requires authentication and authorization. Characteristic issues will arise, such as how to deal with performance deterioration, billing plans, and how to incorporate the concept of revenue into the business plan.

If you don't recognize that SaaS has its own unique challenges, you probably only notice them when you face them. Dealing with these issues first lacks speed and in the end are hard to solve.

## What SaaSus Platform solves

As we know that SaaS has these characteristic challenges, the SaaSus Platform provides a solution as a SaaS itself.

For example, we provide SaaS-specific authentication functions for the following concepts. Tenants, additional work automation when the number of tenants increases (tenant onboarding), authorization according to billing plans, measurement and bill usage, It provides SaaS-specific functions such as business plan formulation and automatic performance input from SaaS billing. Thus the SaaS that provides the best practices of SaaS itself.

By incorporating each feature, you can effortlessly create the tedious parts of SaaS, and you can concentrate on the business knowledge and know-how that SaaS should provide, the implementation of best practices, and continuous improvement.

## What exactly can you do with the SaaSus Platform?

Using the web console, you can configure the basic functions of SaaS. By incorporating the SaaS SDK/API into the web application built by the customer, the basic functions of SaaS will be incorporated into the customer's SaaS based on the settings made on the web console. This reduces development and ongoing operating costs for basic SaaS functionality. In the Î² version, basic functions such as tenant management, user management, login screen generation, role management, billing plan, and billing (Stripe linkage) are available for multi-tenant SaaS.
