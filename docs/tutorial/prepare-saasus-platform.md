## Preparing the SaaSus Platform

### Creating a SaaSus Platform Account

First, let's create a SaaSus Platform account.

Access the registration screen and perform new registration using your own email address.

[https://auth.saasus.io/sign-up](https://auth.saasus.io/sign-up)

Enter your email address and desired password, read the terms of use and privacy policy, check if you agree, and press the sign up button.

When you register for the SaaSus Platform for the first time, we will create a tenant exclusively for you. This takes at least an hour because we will create a customer-dedicated AWS account. Once your account has been created, you will receive an email to the email address you provided.

### Logging into the Console

After the tenant is created, when you log in, you will be prompted to enter user attributes like this.

After filling in the information, the transition page to each console of the tenant is displayed.

**SaaS Development Console** is a console for setting up SaaS construction.

**SaaS Management Console** is a console for managing SaaS.

Details on registration will be provided later.  
First, in order to set up SaaS creation settings log into the **SaaS Development Console**.

Now you are ready to create a multi-tenant SaaS.

Now let's switch to the **SaaS Operation Console** and create SaaS tenants and users!
