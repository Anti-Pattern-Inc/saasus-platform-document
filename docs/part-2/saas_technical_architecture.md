## 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture and Its Benefits

- **Shared Infrastructure**:  
  A single system manages multiple customers (tenants) simultaneously.

- **Efficient Resource Usage**:  
  Optimizes infrastructure costs and operational efficiency by sharing resources.

- **Data Isolation**:  
  Ensures strict separation of data between tenants to maintain security and privacy.

## 2. Basics of Authentication and Authorization (IDaaS, OAuth, OIDC)

- **IDaaS (Identity as a Service)**:  
  Cloud-based identity services that provide user authentication and identity management.

- **OAuth / OIDC**:  
  Industry-standard authentication protocols used to securely control access to resources.

## 3. Ensuring Availability and Resilience (Scaling, Redundancy)

- **Scaling**:  
  Automatically adjusts system resources to accommodate traffic spikes and usage fluctuations.

- **Redundancy**:  
  Leverages multiple data centers and redundant components to minimize the risk of service outages.

## 4. Basics of Logging, Monitoring, and Alerts

- **Logging**:  
  Records system events and errors to support issue analysis and root cause identification.

- **Monitoring**:  
  Continuously tracks the status of servers and applications to maintain optimal performance.

- **Alerts**:  
  Automatically notifies administrators of abnormal events to enable rapid troubleshooting.
