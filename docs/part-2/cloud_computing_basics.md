## 1. Differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**:  
  Provides fundamental IT resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage. Users manage the OS and applications on top of the provided infrastructure.

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**:  
  Offers an environment for application development including OS, middleware, and runtime. Developers can focus on building applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**:  
  Delivers complete applications over the internet to end users. All infrastructure and application maintenance is handled by the service provider.

## 2. Key Features of Cloud (On-demand, Scalability, Flexibility)

- **On-demand Access**:  
  Resources can be provisioned and used instantly, based on business needs, without prior commitments.

- **Scalability**:  
  Systems can scale up or down easily depending on the workload or user demand.

- **Flexibility (Elasticity)**:  
  Cloud environments can automatically handle traffic spikes and fluctuations without manual intervention.

## 3. Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud Models

- **Public Cloud**:  
  Cloud services offered over the internet and shared among multiple organizations. Typically provided by third-party vendors such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

- **Private Cloud**:  
  A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization, providing greater control and security. Often used by enterprises with strict compliance needs.

- **Hybrid Cloud**:  
  Combines public and private cloud environments, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both modelsâ€”such as scalability from public cloud and control from private cloud.
