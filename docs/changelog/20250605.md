We have released updates on the following features.

- Smart MCP Server Feature Release  
  The Smart MCP Server is a new feature that allows APIs generated by the Smart API Gateway to be exposed externally in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) format. MCP-compatible clients can interact with these APIs using natural language.  
  With SaaSus Platform automatically handling infrastructure provisioning, operation, and the application of authentication and authorization settings, developers can easily publish and utilize MCP-enabled APIs without additional configuration.  

  Main features  

  - Expose APIs as an MCP server  
    APIs generated via the Smart API Gateway can be transparently published in MCP format.  

  - Natural language-based API operations  
    MCP-compatible clients can invoke existing APIs using natural language commands.  

  - Automated infrastructure and access control  
    Infrastructure setup, operation, and security policy application required for API publication are automatically handled by the SaaSus Platform, reflecting existing configurations as-is.  

- Smart API Gateway Feature Enhancement  
  A new option has been added to the Smart API Gateway that allows you to choose the authentication method when issuing API keys from the admin console.  
  This enhancement enables flexible balancing between security and usability depending on the use case.  

  Main features  

  - Authentication method selection per API key  
    When issuing an API key, you can select from the following two authentication modes:  
    - Without client secret  
      After obtaining an access token, the API can be used directly without requiring request signing.  
    - With client secret  
      After obtaining an access token, requests must be signed before calling the API (signature required).  

    This allows greater flexibility, such as quick implementation in early development stages, and stricter authentication in production environments with higher security requirements.
