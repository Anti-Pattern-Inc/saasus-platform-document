Thank you for trying out the SaaSus Platform.

We have released the official version of the SaaSus Platform on December 14, 2022.
As a result, all present beta accounts will gradually be switched over to the "Free Plan".
Please note there is a limit of up to 5 users in the Free Plan.

In addition, we are now offering the option to upgrade to our "Standard Plan", which comes without such limitations.
If you're using our official SaaS, we suggest you to consider the Standard Plan as well.

We appreciate your continued support for SaaSus Platform.
