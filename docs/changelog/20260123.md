We have released updates on the following features.

Authentication API  
We have added an "Authentication API" that allows users to authenticate using an email address and password from the SaaS's own login screen.  
In addition to the standard login screen previously provided by the SaaSus Platform, support for authentication via API enables you to build a login experience that is completely integrated with your service's design and brand.  

  Main features  
  - Email/password authentication with custom UI  
    Login processing can be executed by calling the SaaSus API from the backend based on information entered from the   SaaS's own screen (frontend). This realizes a seamless user experience that does not compromise the service's   look and feel.  
  - Optimization for mobile app integration  
    Since authentication is completed via API, it is now easier to flexibly implement login functions in native apps   such as iOS and Android.  
  - Support for secure authentication protocol (SRP)  
    The authentication flow complies with USER_SRP_AUTH. Since verification is performed using a hash value   calculated on the client side, authentication can be completed safely while keeping the password itself secret.
  - Direct retrieval of various tokens  
    Upon successful authentication, the ID token, access token, and refresh token are immediately returned from the   SaaSus Platform. You can smoothly perform subsequent authorization controls and API requests using the obtained   tokens.
