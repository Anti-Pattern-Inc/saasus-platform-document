4. Select 'Approve' for the status, and click the 'Submit' button.

That's it! You've completed the publication request.

Finally, reply to the **"Action Required: AWS Marketplace SaaS Contract Next Steps [ thread::XXXXXXXXXX:: ]"** email by writing a message in **English** that says "Please publish the SaaS product". Once you've replied, your publication request is complete.  
With this process, your SaaS product will be published on the AWS Marketplace by the Support Team within 3 to 5 business days.
