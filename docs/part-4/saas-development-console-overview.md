## 1. Role of the SaaS Development Console

The SaaS Development Console is used in the following situations:

- Initial setup before integrating authentication, billing, and pricing features into your own application  
- Creating the foundational configuration for a new service launch  
- Defining access control policies such as login methods and roles  
- Testing operations and verifying settings prior to production launch  

## 2. Screen Layout and Key Menus

When you log in to the SaaS Development Console, a navigation menu appears on the left side of the screen. From here, you can access various configuration sections.
