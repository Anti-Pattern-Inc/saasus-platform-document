## 4. Security Features Provided by SaaSus Platform

- **Token-Based Authentication**:  
  SaaSus Platform uses token-based authentication, issuing ID tokens, access tokens, and refresh tokens upon login. These tokens are attached to requests to verify user identity.

- **User Activity Log Recording and Visibility**:  
  SaaSus Platform records user activity—such as API executions—and provides a visual interface to review them. These logs are useful for audit trails and detecting unauthorized access.

- **IP Address Restrictions**:  
  SaaSus Platform allows you to restrict authentication requests based on source IP addresses. This helps block unauthorized login attempts from untrusted networks.
