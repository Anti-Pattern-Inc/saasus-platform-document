## 1. Advantages of SaaS

### 1.1 Reducing Initial Investment Costs

Since SaaS typically uses a subscription-based model, there is no need for significant upfront investment when adopting the service.

### 1.2 Scalability and Flexibility

The system can scale its resources easily to accommodate increased usage or a growing number of users.

### 1.3 Reducing Operational Burden

Operational tasks such as security patching, updates, and backups are handled by the service provider, reducing the maintenance load on the user side.

### 1.4 Continuous Updates and Latest Features

SaaS applications are updated regularly, ensuring access to the latest features and security enhancements, which helps maintain competitiveness.

## 2. Disadvantages of SaaS

### 2.1 Customization Limitations

Customization is limited to what the platform allows, making it difficult to meet highly specific internal requirements in some cases.

### 2.2 Risks from External Dependencies

Since users depend on an external service provider, there is a potential risk of service disruption or termination due to provider-side issues.

### 2.3 Security and Compliance Considerations

Proper handling of data, privacy, and compliance must be ensured by both the service provider and the user organization.
