## 1. Data Security Basics (Encryption, Access Control)

- **Encryption**:  
  Encryption technologies are used to secure data during transmission and while at rest.

- **Access Control**:  
  Enforce strict user and administrator access controls based on defined permissions and roles.

## 2. Compliance (GDPR, ISO, SOC, etc.)

- **Compliance Standards**:  
  Support for global and industry-specific standards such as GDPR, ISO, and SOC.

- **Internal Audits**:  
  Conduct regular security audits and compliance checks to ensure adherence to policies and requirements.

## 3. Security Audits and Log Handling

- **Log Management**:  
  Operational logs are recorded to support analysis of unauthorized access and system failures.

- **Audit Procedures**:  
  Define and document procedures for internal and external audits, including access logs and incident records.

## 4. Security Features Provided by SaaSus Platform

- **Token-Based Authentication**:  
  SaaSus uses token-based authentication, issuing ID tokens, access tokens, and refresh tokens upon login. These tokens are attached to requests to verify user identity.

- **User Activity Log Recording and Visibility**:  
  SaaSus records user activity—such as API executions—and provides a visual interface to review them. These logs are useful for audit trails and detecting unauthorized access.

- **IP Address Restrictions**:  
  SaaSus allows you to restrict authentication requests based on source IP addresses. This helps block unauthorized login attempts from untrusted networks.
