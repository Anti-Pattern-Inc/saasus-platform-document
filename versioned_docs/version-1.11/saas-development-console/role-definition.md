# Role Definition

Let's define the roles.

This role represents a role in various SaaS and is used as an authorization standard.

For example, if you have administrator privileges for each tenant, define a role such as "admin", and if you are a general user, assign a role such as "user".

"admin" has already been set up in SaaSus Platform, so this time we will define "user".

Click the "+Create Role" button to display the role creation popup.

Role names are used to identify roles within SaaS applications.

Write the display name so that you understand what its role is.

Now let's add a general user.

- Role Name: user
- Display Name: General User

The creation of the role is now complete.
