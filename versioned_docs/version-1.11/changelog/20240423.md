We have released the following feature updates:

- Addition of user environment definition management functionality  
  The SaaSus Platform has a feature called user environment definition, which allows you to define test users in your SaaS production environment. This is intended for use cases where you expose APIs externally.  
  In response to customer feedback that the SaaSus Platform management console UI was complex and difficult to understand, we have made it possible to choose not to use the user environment definition feature. Please enjoy the simpler and more user-friendly UI!
