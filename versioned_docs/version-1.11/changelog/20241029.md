We have released the following new feature:

- Added Password Email Notification for New SaaS Users  
  Modified the "Create SaaS User" API to make the "password" parameter optional instead of required.  
  Existing API calls will continue to work as before.  
  When making an API call without setting the "password" parameter:
  - A random password will be automatically generated
  - The password will be sent to the user via email

- Added Stripe Subscription Information Retrieval  
  Implemented a new API to fetch Stripe subscription information linked to tenants.  
  Using the information obtained from this API, you can make subsequent Stripe API calls to retrieve more detailed subscription data.
