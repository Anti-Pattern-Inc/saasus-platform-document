We have released the following new feature:

- Addition of Single Tenant Management Function  
  We have added a new feature called "Single Tenant Management Function" for single-tenant architecture. By using this function, when creating a tenant on the SaaSus Platform, servers and databases will be automatically prepared for your AWS environment.  
  You can now SaaS-enable applications that do not support multi-tenancy in the shortest time possible!  
  \*The "Single Tenant Management Function" is available only to customers on the Advanced plan or higher.
