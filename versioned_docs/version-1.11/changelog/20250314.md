We have released the following feature.

- Smart API Gateway Feature Release  
  This functionality allows the SaaSus Platform to expose various features of your application as external APIs by adding specified annotations to your application's source code.  
  With infrastructure and authentication features for API provision automatically provided, you can securely publish external APIs without expertise in API construction or operation.  

Main Features  

- API Key Issuance and Management  
  You can issue and manage API keys for each user and tenant. Since each application user and tenant can have their own unique API key, this enables fine-grained access management.  

- Authentication  
  Authentication is performed using API keys. Clients are authenticated by sending an API key with API requests, allowing you to identify who called which API.  

- Authorization  
  You can control API access through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) based on user roles.  
  This allows you to restrict available API endpoints and resources based on roles assigned to users. Roles can be customized through the SaaSus console or SaaSus API.  

- Throttling  
  Different throttling settings can be configured for each endpoint, allowing you to set rate limits on API calls.  
  You can individually control the call frequency of each API endpoint according to its importance and load, ensuring overall system performance and stability.  

- IP Control  
  You can allow access only from specific IP addresses or IP ranges.  
  Even in environments with strict security requirements, this restricts API access to only designated connection sources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
