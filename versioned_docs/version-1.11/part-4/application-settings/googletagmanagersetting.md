By setting up Google Tag Manager, you can embed Google Tag Manager tags in the login screen, and configure Google Analytics and other services.

Marketing activities are crucial for SaaS operations, so let's set up Google Tag Manager to acquire information about users and traffic sources.

First, create a Google Tag Manager account and container.

[Create a Google Tag Manager Account and Container](/docs/part-4/application-settings/googletagmanagersetting/googletagmanagercreateaccountandcontainer)

Once you have created the Google Tag Manager account and container, you can actually set up Google Tag Manager in your SaaS.

Now, the Google Tag Manager tag is embedded in the login screen, so you can integrate with Google Analytics to collect user behavior data.

If you haven't created a Google Analytics account yet, please check the following document.

If you have already created a Google Analytics account or completed the account creation, set up Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager with the following document.
