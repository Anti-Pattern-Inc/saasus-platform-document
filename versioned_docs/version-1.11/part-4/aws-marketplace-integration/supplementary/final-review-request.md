Once you have completed the [exhibition steps '10. Confirmation of integration with AWS Marketplace'](/docs/aws-marketplace-integration/aws-marketplace-integration), you can request a final review from the AWS Marketplace support team.

First, access the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/homepage" target="_blank">AWS Marketplace Management Portal</a> and open the product detail page you want to manage.

Then click on `Update visibility` located on the right of the alert displayed at the top of the page.

After the transition, set the Visibility options to `public`.

An additional form to enter the contract amount will be displayed. After entering the correct amount, click `Submit`.
