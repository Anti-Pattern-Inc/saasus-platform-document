:::caution
Please ensure that your bank account setup is complete beforehand. If you haven't done this yet, refer to [Bank Account Setup](/docs/aws-marketplace-integration/aws-marketplace-seller-registration/register-bank-account).
:::

Click `Add disbursement method` under `Payment Information`.

First, select the currency in which disbursements will be made. For available currencies, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/disbursement.html#currency).

Next, select the bank account to receive disbursements. Among the bank accounts added in [Bank Account Setup](/docs/aws-marketplace-integration/aws-marketplace-seller-registration/register-bank-account), only the accounts corresponding to the previously selected currency will be available as options.

Finally, set the disbursement schedule. This will be the schedule on which AWS disburses funds to the sellerâ€™s bank account. The following screenshot shows a setting where disbursements are made on the 1st of every month. If you select `Daily`, sellers must have a positive balance to receive disbursements.

:::warning
Public Offers only support USD; therefore, it is required to set up a disbursement method in USD. Even if you plan to create a Private Offer in Japanese Yen only, ensure that both USD and JPY disbursement methods are set.

With this, the necessary settings to start the listing process are complete.
