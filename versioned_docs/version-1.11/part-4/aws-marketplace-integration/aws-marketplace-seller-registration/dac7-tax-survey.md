DAC7 refers to the European Commission's directive regarding tax reporting by corporations.  
This directive imposes a tax reporting obligation on subsidiaries, parent corporations, proportionate consolidation corporations, joint ventures and decentralized corporations in the European Union.  
Information sharing on taxation is required to prevent attempts to reduce domestic tax through business expansion or the start of new businesses under control of overseas enterprises.
