## Behavior when working with Stripe

Canceling a pricing plan will cancel the corresponding Stripe subscription.  
Please note that no refunds will be given in that case.

## Cancel Pricing Plan Immediately

1. Go to Pricing Plan Settings in the SaaS Operations Console.
2. Click "Release" for the tenant whose pricing plan you want to release.
3. For Reflection Date, select "Reflected immediately".
4. Click Unlock.
5. A confirmation message will be displayed. Check the contents and click "Remove".

**\*When "Reflected immediately" is selected, the pricing plan will take effect about 5 minutes after the operation.**  
_Example, Cancellation setting of pricing plan at 9:00 am on December 28, 2022 â†’ cancellation at 09:05:00 on December 28, 2022_
