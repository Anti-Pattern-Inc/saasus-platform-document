## About canceling a scheduled change

A schedule will be created when you select "Date and time specification" as the reflection timing during pricing plan setup, change, or cancellation.  
When the specified date and time comes, operations for setting, changing, and canceling rate plans are automatically performed based on the created schedule.  
You can cancel the change up to 10 minutes before the specified date and time by following the steps below.

1. Go to Pricing Plan Settings in the SaaS Operations Console.
2. Click “Cancel Schedule” for the tenant whose schedule you want to cancel.
3. A confirmation message will be displayed. If there is no problem, click "OK".
