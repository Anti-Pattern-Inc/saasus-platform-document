We have released updates on the following features.

- Dashboard Feature Release (Usage Metrics)  
  We have added a "Dashboard" feature that visualizes service usage and growth trends.  
  Simply by using the authentication and authorization features of the SaaSus Platform, metrics are automatically aggregated and graphed based on accumulated data.  
  This enables customers to intuitively grasp daily user growth and tenant acquisition trends as business growth indicators, without any additional implementation or special configuration.

  Main features

  - Tenant count trend display  
    Displays a graph showing the trend of tenants created by date.  
    You can see at a glance the growth trend of adopting companies in B2B SaaS.

  - User count trend display  
    Displays a graph showing the trend of users created by date.  
    You can visualize the service scale expansion status and user registration growth curve to support current situation analysis.

  We have released the above two metrics as the first phase. We plan to sequentially add various indicators that can be utilized for business decision-making going forward.
