We have released updates on the following features.

Dashboard Feature Expansion (Usage Metrics)  
Page-by-Page Access Statistics  
We have added "Page-by-Page Access Statistics" to the "Dashboard" feature that visualizes service growth trends.  
In addition to the previous tenant count and user count trends, visualizing the usage status of each page within the application enables more multifaceted service analysis.  
In environments where the SaaSus Platform is implemented, you can immediately start analysis based on accumulated data without any special configuration or additional implementation.  

  Main features  
  - Page-by-page usage visualization. 
    Access counts for each page (URL path) within the application are aggregated and can be checked on the dashboard.  
    You can identify which features are most utilized and use this information to optimize your service.  
  - Flexible aggregation period selection. 
    Statistical data can be displayed by specifying any period, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
　　By comparing trends across different periods, you can identify the effects of new feature releases and changes in user behavior.  
  - Automatic reflection when pages are added  
    When new pages are added, the SaaSus Platform automatically detects them and includes them in the statistics, allowing you to always grasp the latest situation without operational costs.  
  - Automatic data updates  
    Statistical data is automatically updated regularly, enabling you to monitor the latest usage status in near real-time.

With this update, you can now grasp the health status of your service from both business metrics (tenant and user counts) and activity metrics (page access) perspectives.  
We will continue to sequentially expand indicators that are useful for analysis going forward.
